Physical real-paper books are struggling and I usually find big deals in libraries (specially in [Books-a-million](www.booksamillion.com)), and since I come from a country where you pay high taxes for books, just like they were cigarettes or alcohol, I go crazy buying and I've been accumulating quite a few books lately.

Here is a list of the books I have and should read before buying new ones:

- [*Fatherhood*](http://amzn.com/0425097722) by Bill Cosby.
- [*I Didn't Ask to Be Born: (But I'm Glad I Was)*](http://amzn.com/B004QZ9QMI) by Bill Cosby.
- [*Reagan's Secret War*](http://amzn.com/B002C1YUC4) by Martin Anderson and Annelise Anderson.
- [*Making It All Work*](http://amzn.com/B001AO0GRC) by David Allen.
- [*Bicycle Diaries*](http://amzn.com/B0044KLQGY) by David Byrne.
- [*The Religious Test*](http://amzn.com/B003WIYCVU) by Damon Linker.
