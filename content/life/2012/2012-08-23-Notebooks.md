We just visited Chile for a few weeks. It was a very emotional trip, we faced a lot of
things we had only heard and saw of in a computer screen. At the end we had mixed
feelings: Our physical home is here, but our emotional home is back there.

A nice surprise, that I already had in my last visit, is to find that [CasaIdeas](http://www.casaideas.com/)
is selling a lot of beautiful and cheap notebooks and paper-related products. Actually my wife gave
me this nice [folder+notebook](http://www.casaideas.com/catalogo/index.php/cl/papeleria/cuadernos-y-libretas/folder-viaje.html), which I think is going to be my new note-taking tool.

I love it, since it has a pen holder and plenty of storage space for receipts, cards, and other stuff.
I know that you can probably find very similar and fancier products in the market, but I was pleased with
the design and the price tag (around $8.00).

That's it for now.
