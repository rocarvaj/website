Here goes a not-so-exciting post. I just want to keep a more regular
writing routine. I just have two things to talk about.

The first one is not very new, but every once in a while I run into [this post](http://rdd.me/ekzmcy7d).
Is a very inspirational post about small things you can do to improve your
life. It is probably hard to follow all of them, but at least you can get
good ideas.

The second one is that my wife is finally on [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com),
so I started to visit it too. I remember that when I joined it, there were too
much women stuff (not that I don't like women stuff... It was just too much). Now
things are a bit more balanced. An example: [Notebook porn](http://pinterest.com/search/?q=notebooks).

Oh!, and should probably say: [Follow me on Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/rocarvaj/).
