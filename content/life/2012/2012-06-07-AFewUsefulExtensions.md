Here is a list of a few Google Chrome extensions that I find useful.
I've tried not to do what I did back in the day when I used Mozilla
Firefox: Install all kinds of extensions without actually keeping track of which ones I would really use.

* [Google dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja).
It is not just a link to Googling "define <my-word>", you can double click over a word and a nice pop-up comes out with
the definition and a link to search Google for the term.

* [Readability](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi).
I would love it if the whole internet could be first processed with Readability, it is a tool to convert web pages into
a more readable format. Nowadays is very hard for me to read a blog/article without using it. The Chrome extension
allows you to read the current page in Readability, or save it for later.

* [Clock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoihofapbdnldlhecnhefifbcddgdkhm).
This little extension comes installed in Chrome. Very simple, but with enough functions: Alarm, timer (for [brewing your perfect
cup of coffee in a french press](http://stumptowncoffee.com/guide/press-pot/)), stopwatch, etc.

* [Writebox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bbehjmjchoiaglkeboicbgkpfafcmhij). An offline editor for [Dropbox](www.dropbox.com).
I really don't know why Dropbox does not have its own web-based text editor, I've read that maybe is because Dropbox's main concern is syncing and users can develop tools to play with it.

* [Scratchpad](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kjebfhglflhjjjiceimfkgicifkhjlnm). I'm a big fan of Google Docs, but
I would love to be able to edit a text document in a very minimal editor. Scratchpad allows you to do this, giving you offline support.
But, to be honest, lately the syncing hasn't been working very well. Also for some reason it does not allow me to paste text in plain-text
format. That's why lately I've been managing my notes with...

* [Catch](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pondcljgicihhdfcnlflkikegfbnalmp). This is a dead-simple extension, to collect notes
to [Catch.com](www.catch.com). Catch.com is a simple note taking service, way simpler than [Evernote](www.evernote.com) and
[Springpad](www.springpad.com) (and actually that's something I like about it). I'm a widower of the great Google Notebook, and Catch.com
is the closest thing so far.

That's it! Let me know if you have some other good extensions to recommend.
