I've been a big fan of Chrome OS since I got a [cr-48](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook#CR-48_prototype)
from Google. It made me realize that in a computer I usually use a browser and terminal, that's all I need.

Of course one big concern is the dependence on the web for working, since it is possible to coenwct via ssh
to remote machines with the Secure Shell extension in the Chrome store. Installing a different Linux
distribution is a possibility, but I don't want to miss the Chrome OS experience in general.

So after some googling, I found [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) that provides some kind of
virtualization and allows a guest operating system to run using Chrome OS. I'm a little weak on the details
of how it works, but there are more details if you follow the link.
